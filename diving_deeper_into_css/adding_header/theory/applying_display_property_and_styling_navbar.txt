* since the div and nav are not inline elements but are block elements, they are on the new line.
  now , after setting them as inline, we have them on the same line,

* now we want to set the nav element to the right

* now we can try one thing, since we have list items, that are turned into inline,and a ul also turned into ul, 
  we can use text-align:right on the .main-nav

* but nothing changes, if we inspect, the elements(lis) are aligned to the right,
  due to inheritance the ul also has the text-align:right .

* so the css is applied, but doesnt have any effect, bcz, ul is inline block element and doesnt take the full width
  it only has width as it content needs, so text-align :right doesnt do anything here

* so we need to instead apply width so the width: is widht of the navbar - div
  now the ul still has problem, since it has addnl padding and margin, so we make them to 0

* we can do calc(100% - 49px (div width)) ,it became narrower, but it is still inline.
   this is due to inline-block , so we need to have a better understanding on it, otherwise it may take hours.
