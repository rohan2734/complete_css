 DISPLAY PROPERTY
* the display property allows us to change the behaviour of the element from 
  block to inline or block and inline 
* we cannot set margin top and bottom for inline elements
* they are not positioned as the block
ex: for inline
  anchor tags, they are rendererd as inline by default
  
ex: for block
  list item behaves as a block element, it takes full width of the content in a line

ex:for inline-block
  when we have set the li item. style as display:inline-block
  here it is not only inline but it is also a block element, 
  and we can add padding, and margin 
 
  when we apply a padding:20px  for the anchor tag, we see that it is only affected on left and right
  but when we apply on the list item( here the list item is inline block) ,
  then the padding is applied around it , top, bottom, left and right
  that is the difference. 

  later we will see , we use flex-box for posiitioning elements side by side, as it is better than inline-block
