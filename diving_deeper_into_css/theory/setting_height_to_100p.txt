/* when height:100%, then it takes the margin of the h1, also
the reason for this is , it takes the 100% of the available height only given by parent*/
/* if we want the section to be 100%, then we need to change the height of the main, then body, then html to be 100%, then
we will be able to achieve this,
well the alternative is to provide the height as 528px also */
