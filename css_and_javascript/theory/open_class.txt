if we click choose plan, we still have the backdrop ,but the modal doesnt open
because  open class is added, but it is overwritten by modal class

reason  is
we have open class in shared.css

modal in main.css  
which we have imported after the shared.css 

this overwrites any specifity that we defiend earlier like open class

we can add important here
because this really a class when it must take absolute prioity

otherwise we would repositonn modal class infrotn of open class
buthis approach is ok too
