* when we have set a background-position:20px, 
  we see that the image is moved to the right 20px .
* the first value is the x-axis, it defines that 
  how the left edge should be positioned to the left edge of the parent
* if we set another value  , it is the y-axis, it defines that
  how the top edge should be positioned to the top edge of the parent.
* we can also  set a percentage value, but when we reload , there is no widespace
* by percentage , we can define , how much of the excess space 
  ( the parts of the image, that doesnt make into the container ) how these parts 
   should be distributed.
* now regarding the width, the full width of the imagae is displayed,
   it is not cropped.
* now if we set the background-position:0%, which means the lef part of the excess space
  is perfectly aligned to the container.
* we can also set the top,background-position:0% 10%,this means, the 10% of the excess space
  should go over the top.
* if we reload, the image, begin pushed down, the default is 50%, 
  we get the same result, as if we have not mentioned it.
* 50% means off the parts of the image, that doesnt fit to the container,
  50% will be cropped at the bottom, and 50% will be cropped at the top.
* if we have set 0% 10%, which means 10% is cropped at the top, and 90% is cropped at the bottom.
  so the image will be pushed down.
* if we have set 0% 100%, all the extra space will be cropped at the top, and nothing will be cropped at the bottom,
  this results, in pushing up the image, and bottom edge, will be perfectly aligned to the 
  bottom edge of the parent.
* if we have set, background-position: center 50% 50%; 50% of the top and bottom, and 50% of the left and right
  is cropped , so that the center of the image, is the center of the container.
* we can also set to background-position: left top;, this means the left part of the image is perfectly aligned to the container,
  and the top is also perfectly aligned , so no cropping at the left and top.
* we can also set to background-position: left top; , then bottom is perfectly aligned, and the top is cropped.
* we can also set to background-position: left  40% bottom 40%;, then 40% of the bottom and 40% of the left is cropped,
