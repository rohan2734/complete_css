* if we add a dashed border of 5px, (before the background-origin added)
* we see that , the left and right is in the container( acc to lec, ours top and bottom is filled in container)
* but we see the top and bottom is not filled.
* so if we add a background-origin :border-box, the problem is solved.
* by default the container  is not the border-bpx, and therefore
  we have the white space.
* if we try, content-box, we see some padding, on right and left.
* so default is padding-box, this means, the container including the content and padding, but not border.
* since the croping wasnt effective with  background origin, we add background-clip
* if we set the background-clip: border-box;, we got the same behaviour as before,
* if we set the  background-clip: padding-box;so now we see the border is empty, so no image beneath the top and bottom.
* so with the background-clip, we define where the image should be clipped, and now it is clipped after the  padding.
* we can also set it to content , to set to before the padding, we get some space around it.
* it also overrides background-origin, 
* background-attachment: ;tells whether the image should be moving according to the content of the container
