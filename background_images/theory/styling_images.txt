* when we add a uhost-icon-image, in the place of the name as the logo,
* we see the logo is too big, 
*  
.main-header__brand {
    color: #0e4f1f;
    text-decoration: none;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 22px;
    height: 22px;
}

* in shared.css, we can think that, height:22px, will solve the issue,
* but here the main-header__brand is the container
<a href="index.html" class="main-header__brand">
    <!-- uHost -->
    <img src="./images/uhost-icon.png" alt="uHost-Your favorite hosting company"/>
</a>
* if it was the image, then it would be set properly
* by setting the height of the container,the image will not be affected ,
  because the default  behaviour .
* the default behaviour is, if u enter an img tag , and we point to an image,
  thent the default height n width of the image will  be used in the document,
  no matter how much width and height u set for the surrouding element.
*  if we inspect, the anchor tag is much smaller than that, but the image doesnt care.

* now the only solution is to , write the css style for the image,
  now we can set a height:22px, but what if we do height:100%, it doesnt work.
* height:100%, will again lead us to its original height, not the height defined by the container.
* so should now set the final height of the image , we want to set here.

* so when we add, a width:100%, here we dont see any changes, so percentage values doesnt help 
  us in fitting it to the container,
* because the reason for that ,is our container is a inline element itself.
* if we set it to inline -block instead, not the image respects the container.
* so while setting the style of the images, it is important if it is contained in a inline-block , or block or an inline element.
