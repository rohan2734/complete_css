* in the image_container, if we want to set its width:80%, then it needs to have display:inline-block
* and also the image , would have the width:100%, also

* now , we see that the image and the div are not vertically aligned because,
  we have vertical-align:middle on testimonial_info but not on image_container,
* so if we add vertical-align:middle on the image_container also it would also be aligned vertically

* if we add a  box-shadow on the container, and we reload, 
* we see that there is a white edge below, that we can get rid by
  adding vertical-align:middle or top or anything on the testimonial_image
* or alternative would be display:block,
