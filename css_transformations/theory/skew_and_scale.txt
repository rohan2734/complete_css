skew element is added on transform 
it is used to skew the element on x axis or y axis 
but here if we use skew function like this, and you only enter one value 
you are skewing only on X axis, it is just like adding value to skewX

if you enter skewX(20deg) somone pulled the website left a little bit 
if you enter skewY(20deg) someone pulled the website up a little bit 

if container is skewed but not image 

to hide the overflow of the child elements
you can add overflow:hidden

scale:
if you add 2 to it 
it will increase the size to twice
