translate function on transform property 

we can use translateX and translateY 
translateZ can be used for 3D 

we can enter rem , percentage, etc

when we use translateX(10rem)
it is also moving down, since we rotated the 
element

so it is moving diagonally 
so if we remove the rotation, it will move in 
horizontally

and after that ,we can also increase the width , 
and then use text align

also if you want to remove the extra part of the recomended badge 
it will be overflow : hidden

important:
translateX and translateY axis changes when we rotated the element
