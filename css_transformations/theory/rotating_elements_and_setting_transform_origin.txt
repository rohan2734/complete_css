* transform:rotate('45deg') makes the element to 
rotate around the center of the element 

* transform-origin:  you can change the posiiton with which 
it should change 
* for ex: you can change it to left top, (default is center )

left top translates with respect to top  left corner 
you can also enter 1rem 1rem, 1 rem to the right, and 1 rem down from the top left corner 
or 50%, it would be center (default)
or we can also make it to 25% 50%
50% 50% would be equal to center
