think of media queries,just like  if conditions

@media ()

all our code outside the media queries is our mobile code
(the code that specifies the look of our website on mobile devices)

if u r going to design websites for website devices, and media quries for mobile devices, then we use  max-width

we can also have mulitple media queries

if there are 2 media queries, the second one overwrites the first one, due to the css nature
