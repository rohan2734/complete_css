flex-direction: row;
flex-wrap: nowrap;

when we cahnge nowarp to wrap 
the height is changed and the last element enters new line

we also have wrap-reverse, the order is just reversed 

flex -direction : column , it is the same as our block elements behave 

 our elements have a specified width,only display upto which we defined

 when we drag the console towards,the lemeents are not displayed below the value 
 
 we can see that, few divs which dont have any width , reudce the size even below the point, at which it requires

 we also have column reverse 
 we also have row reverse
