Main axis vs cross axis:

main axis is from top left to top right 
corss axis goes from top left to bottom left 

flex-diretion : row (main axis and left to right)

flex-diretion: row-reverse

it starts from right top corner to left top corner 

and cross goes from right top corner to bottom corner 

* flex-wrap:wrap 
if we  decrease the width, it wraps  along the cross axis 
first flex is still on the top left corner 

now if we change the flex diretion to row reverse 
* now starting point is top right corner, and when we decrease the width , they are aligned along cross axis 

* flex-direction:column
 the main axis is from top to bottom 
 and thecross axis is from left to right 


* flex direction mainly decoeds if the main axis is from left to right or top to bottom 

* flex direction column-reverse is from bottom to top, or from left lower corner to right 

if flex -direction row , then the starting point is left top corener and row defines the main axis 

if flex-direction is row reverse,starting point is right top  corner ,main axis is row 

if flex-direction is column, starting point is top left corner, but main direciton is from top lef tto bottom 

and if flex direciton is column reverse, starting poing is bottom left corner, and main axis is column 

 if we use flex direciton as column 
 the items are aligned on main axis, that is from top to bottom
