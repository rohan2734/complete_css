flex-grow: 0
its initial value is 0

the element who got flex-grow:1
occupies the space 

the remaining space is divided into 5 (flex-grow:1 , for element 4, and flex-grow:4 for element 6)

so 1/5tth will be applied to first element 
and 4/5th will be applied to last element 

if we add a flexrwp : to wrap 
then last element will go the the second line 
and it would occupy the whole space
