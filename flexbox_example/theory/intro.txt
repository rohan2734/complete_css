* flexbox is the modern way to change the way our elements are displayed

flex-container 
main axis vs cross axis 
the flex items 

- inline block is the nice way to change the posiiton of elements 
 but flex box can make things like that easier

- if we check navigation , in main nav,the width of it as calculation with pixels
  
- we would like to remove the display inline block declaration and replace with flex box

- the right  plan is smaller  , than left plan , so to correct this we are making flex box
