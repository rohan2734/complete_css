* if we dont add the fontfamily property to our code in the website, then the default browser settings is the one that defines 
* the disadvantage is , fontfamily totally depends on user settings , we dont have any contorl on font family on our website 

* quotation marks are not necessary,it will still work 
* sans-serif is a generic family 
* the general pattern is, we start with most specific font family , or two or more families
 * "montserrat" , "verdana" , sans-serif
* browser will look for "montserrat" , if we cant find we will move to next family, "verdana" , and so on so on, and at last it may fall back to sans-serif 

* if we had the link,we had to add it in each html file we had ,otherwise the font is not available 
* so this can cause errors
* so the alternative is , @import , this allows us to import the font in the css file, by using it 
* now add the @Import in shared.css file 
* just add @import part in shared.css and remove the fonts link in the index.html etc
