* if we dont add the fontfamily property to our code in the website, then the default browser settings is the one that defines 
* the disadvantage is , fontfamily totally depends on user settings , we dont have any contorl on font family on our website 

* quotation marks are not necessary,it will still work 
* sans-serif is a generic family 
* the general pattern is, we start with most specific font family , or two or more families
 * "montserrat " , "verdana" , sans-serif
* browser will look for "montserrat" , if we cant find we will move to next family, "verdana" , and so on so on, and at last it may fall back to sans-serif
