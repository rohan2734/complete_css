* line-height doesnt consider decimals 
* so ,19px is very close to 19.2 px (font size)

* if we increase the line-height to 2 , height becomes 38.4, so it becomes 38
* line-height to normal .then we have line-height is 24

* line-height depends on the font we are using , we can also use px, or percentage 
* if we use %, as 200%, then 200% of font size 
* percentage is not good , since it leads to unexpected behaviour due to inheritance
