* font-weight must be written before font size 
* font-weight also is written before font size , it is important 
* font-style is also written before font size
* line-height is added after font-size 
* font-family is the last value we specify
* line-height is added as font-size/line-height as 1.2rem/2 

font: status-bar;

* the font shorthand doesnt apply when we just write as font:1.2 rem
we need atleast font-weight and font-family 
* os we need to write font-size:1.2rem
