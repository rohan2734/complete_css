* custom fonts ,that we imported by at font-face 
* font display is a property,we can apply different values which impact the loading behavour of the custom fonts 
* we have different values like ,swap , block ,fallback ,optional  ->if we dont set anyhting it will be set to auto 
* 2 different situations while the loading process of the font takes place 
for swap value we dont have any block period 
* block-period : user is visitng the website , content has to load, as fonts cannt be displayed immediately, the sapce where our text 
  will be displayed, and it will be received by flalback font, it will not be received initially, but the sapce will be reserved 
  we dont have the styling, we will have the general strucutre, and we wont have text 

* swap -period -:where browser has ability to swap the fallback fonts 
 this period is infinite ,if our browswer manages to load our custom font , then it would swap the fall back ,
    if it cannot change ,fallback would just stay there 

* block : block-period 
  inviisble font is loaded, we dont have any text but we have reserved space  ,after that the behaviour is reload the fallback, 
   and once again load the custom font that we created 

* fallback has very short block-period ,we have this invisible font family displaved only for a minimal amoutn of time, then we have fallback 
  then we have a very shot period of time to change the fallback font and swap wth custom font, if browser can do the swapping  in the short time
  then it will change to custom font, else it will use the fallback 

* optional , it iwll have very short blockperiod, we dont have swap period, becasue it allows the browser to choose the custom font or fallback 
 if the browser has good internet it uses custom font, or it uses fallback 
  and it cannot be received 

* auto:
 if we dont set font-display, auto wil be applied
