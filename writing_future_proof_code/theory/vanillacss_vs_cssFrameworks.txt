- css frameworks like bootstrap 

- we have vanilla CSS , we write basic css with basic features

we have component frameworks like, foundation, or bootstrap4
these are 3rd party packages 

- they are packages of css code , which gives 
pre styled components and utility features and classes 

- utility frameworks 
tailwand css

- bootstrap 

getbootstrap.com 

bootstrap package is a css framework , which you can simply install 
by putting the link in the html file, that will download the  bootstrap styles

then we can use their layout utilies like their own grid 

they also give alerts, buttons, 
these are all normal html elements, but by attatching the css classes,they 
immediately look the way , they look here 

we save a lot of time writing the code 

- tailwind CSS 

it is an alternative approach to bootstrap , but it follows a different approach 
this doesnt offer  , with a bunch of components 

it offers a bunch of utilies 

these classes allows you to achieve certain looks, and behaviours 

- we get more control on the final outcome 
- and the look of the outcome ,

which one should you use them ?
