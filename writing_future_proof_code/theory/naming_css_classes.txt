choosing class names correctly 

classnames
Dos
use kebab case 

Dont:
use snake case 

because CSS is case insensitive 

Dos:
name your classes by title 
ex: .page-title 

we know that this refers to the page title 

Donts:
naming by style
ex" .title-blue 

we followed a convention called Block element Modifier
(BEM)

and also avoid clashes

therefore BEM enforces a way of naming the classes 
and avoids the risk 

 . Block _ _ element -- Modifier
