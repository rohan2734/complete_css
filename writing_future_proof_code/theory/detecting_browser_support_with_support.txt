some browsers dont even support 
these prefixed versions ,so support quries can help with that

condition  is a css property value pair 
where you can check that property and value 
if that is supported  by the browser 
if the browser cant, then it will not execute the code
between the curly braces 

@supports (display:flex){
    .container{
        display:grid;
    }
}

in our project, we can check if our browser will support a grid 
or not

after adding it ,
we need to shift the body code up of the support query 
and remove the grid related properties 

also overwrite the padding:0 
since we already added a row in the grid for the padding 

we can also use and ,or,not to build complex support queries
