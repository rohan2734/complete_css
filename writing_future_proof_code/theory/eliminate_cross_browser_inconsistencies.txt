some browsers are cross browsers inconsistencies 

different browsers use different defaults

default font family the h1 tags get 

some elements have different margins, paddings 
different box sizing 
boxsizing is set to border box in some browsers 

this is not bad
different browsers use different defaults

some users might pick the browsers 
because of some of the defaults it offers 

but some defaults are also annoying and you want
to have a consistent look  of your webpage across 
browsers too 

therefore we can implement some reset libraries like normalise
css 
which is a css package you add 
as one of the first imports or as the first import in 
your HTMLfile , which overwrites the global browser defaults

ex:
set box sizing to border box for all elements or you do that
manually


* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

this is universal selector

we can also download a package but it will increase the 
page size 

so keeping in mind that, resetting some features, makes sense
and that you can do it manually with the star
selector 
or by using packages is defeinitely something which is 
important
