polyfill is a javascript package
which enables certain CSS Features in Browsers 
which would not support it otherwise

vendor prefixes which helps us support older browsers 
and about the support queries which helps us implement nice
fallbacks 

sometimes we dont want to implement a fallback, we want 
to use the cool Feature, which we can use in modern browsers too

some CSS Features called polyfill exists,these are
javascript packages which we can download and import into the code 

then they will simply parse the CSS code and styleyour page 
accordingly 

basically they implement  a certain feature, by fallng back
to other css features and kind of replicating the look 
which we wanted to have

now polyfills are not available for every CSS feature,
ex:
for the grid, there are no polyfills 
because the grid uses some techniques, that cant be replicated
easily with vanilla CSS and javascript

for some features, polyfills are an option 

polyfills come at a cost, 
it is a javascriptpackage, you download, you add and  import 
into HTML File 

therefore users have to download it, then it will exeucte
and parse the DOM, and manipulate the  stlyes 
this all impacts the performance of the page

some features might be complicated to replicate , 
we should consider if implementing a fallback with supports
isnt a better solution

polyfills are a great tool but you should use them with care 
and use them rarely

ex: 
Rem ,
older browsers dont support rem 
there is a polyfill which we candownload, and importwhich will 
convertall the rem declarations to pixels 
which are supported by older browsers too
