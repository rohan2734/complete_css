we are going to remove the display:inline-block 
in all the css of shared.css 
also the calc of width of main nav 
and should be replaced with flex box solution 

sincew we want to convert the main header to flex ,so 
1. we add display:flex
we added display flex, so default is row 
here we can see that , we need to make the items get aligned 
so main axis is left to right ,cross axis is top to bottom 

main header is also part of the flex container ,so we should remove the display:inline-block 

the flex doesnt applied to nested items, so we are adding vertical align again

1.we turned main header to flex container
2. we turned into flex items
3. we are able to get rid of flex items
