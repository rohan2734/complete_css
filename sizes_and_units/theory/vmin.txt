* when we add the vmin, now our width becomes smaller
* and the reason for this is , vmin takes simple 80% of the smaller viewport
* now if we increase, the size by moving the console, now it doesnt increase
* because now the smaller viewport is height, height is samller than width


* we can increase the viewport size, and the backdrop width doesnt increase, since it will always take 80% of smaller viewport
* now but if we reduce, that, at point where height and width of the viewport are equal
* now it chunks to take 80% of the viewport width.
