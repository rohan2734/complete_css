* if we change the font size in the google chrome settings to very large
* we see that , the navbar font size increases, but the font for the text beside the images
  stays the same.since our font size is 20px.
* when we see the testimonial__info, the font size is 20px, 
  but when we see the h1, the font-size is not 20px, it is 2em
* now if we go to computed tab. and we go down, we can see  
  the font-size is 40px, and 20px is striked off
* for h2,tag, we applied font-size of 18px, if we untick that , then we can see
  that font-size is 1.5 em, an dif we again go to computed
  now we have 30px, again it is 20px X 1.5, 30px, so basically
  em is multiplied with the font which is inherited.
* for p, we had font-size :20px, and even if we change the font size in the settings,
  these doesnt change, but it should .

* here we can face issues , with em values because of inheritance, but to avoid that confusion with inheritancea nd multiplication
  we can use rem, it is just the value multiplied with font-size of browser.
