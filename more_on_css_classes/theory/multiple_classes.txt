.main-section {
    height: 800px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    padding: 16px;
}

.highlighted{
    border: 2px solid #fa923f;
}


<section id="intro" class="main-section  highlighted">
  <p>This is the intro section.</p>
</section>

* here the order of the main-section and highlighted classes matters
* when the highlighted class is coded after the main-section, then the style gets applied.
* and when the highlighted class is coded before the main-section , then the style doesnt get applied.


a.active{
    
}
* if the space is not there b/w the a and .active, 
* then the style gets applied to 

  <a href="#intro" class="active">Intro</a>

but when you write the styles with the space b/w a and .active

a .active{
    
}
* then this would target the elements, that has a tag or the active class but not both of them
