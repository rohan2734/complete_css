:not(p){
  color:red
}

* here you can pass any element , you want to exclude
* it applies the style to any element which is not a paragraph

a:not(.active){
    color:blue;
}

* here we shouldnt give space, since it would select any elements nested in the anchor tag and not the active class
* but we want to select direclty the anchor tags which dont have the active class

* instead we can also write simply 
a{
  color:blue
}
* and that would anyway overwritten by any active class with anchor tag,
like
a.active{
  color:#521751;
}
* to avoid complexity, and to understand the code very easily
