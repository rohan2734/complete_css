* float : means you overwride the defaukt positioning to the left or right of the page 
* we can also take it out of the document flow


* when we use float:right, it is moved to the right, and the below element takes its place
* the text now floats around the element

* it is not good for positioning blocks, because the text will respond to it,
  but the other block level elements wont
* it is great for positioning , text or images, or content

* so we basically, have to keep its place, and tell the other block elements, that come after it
  that they shouldnt repsect any previous floatings

* so we add an aditional div, after the element we floated
  so after the free plan section
* so give a div a class , and we add one property, clear:both;
  it means,  clear float on both sides, left and right
  this means any elements coming after this class, will not respect 
  previous floats.
