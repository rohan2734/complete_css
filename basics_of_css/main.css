/* here the #product-overview h1 is given more preference than h1, so the font family of the #product-overview h1{} is applied on its h1 rather than
font family of h1 selector */

/* we cannot use ids more than once for styling,
but we can use classes more than once for styling */

/* here the order of over riding matters only for same class or selector
but it doesnt matter for different class over riding the css of the same element */

/* cascading means, multiple rules can apply to the same element */

/* specifity
* resolve conflicts arising from multiple rules
* inline styles > 
* id selectors
* .class,:psuedo class and [attribute] selectors
* <tag> and ::psuedo-element selectors */

/* INHERITANCE
* if we add a "*" selector , it applies stlyes to all the elements
*but it has the least priority, so it is inefficient
* instead we can use body
 */

/* combinators allows us to combine multiple selectors to be more precise about  what you want to select */
/* example is #product-overview h1{} here it is  a combinator, since we used multiple selectors */

/* UNDERSTANDING COMBINATORS
  *Adjacent sibling 
  div + p{

  }
  * these can be more than two also
  example :
    h2+ p { 
      color:red
    }
    <div>
      <h2>Not applied</h2>
      <p>css applied</p> //style is applied to this p , since it is adjacent to the h2
      <h2>Not applied <h2>
      <h3>Not applied </h3>
      <p>Not applied </p>
      <h2>Not applied </h2>
      <p>css applied </p> //style is applied to this p , since it is adjacent to the h2
    </div>
  
  *General sibling
    div ~ p{

    }
    example :
    h2 ~p{
      color:red;
    }
      <h2>Not applied</h2>
      <p>css applied</p> 
      <h2>Not applied <h2>
      <h3>Not applied </h3>
      <p>css applied </p>
      <h2>Not applied </h2>
      <p>css applied </p>
      //here all the p get the styles applied even though the second p doesnt follow the p directlty 
      //for general sibling, if there is a  h2 for a p , then the styles are applied
      // p doesnt need to follow the sibling h2 directly
  
  * Child
    div > p{
      color: red
    }
    <div>
      <div>not applied</div>
      <p>css applied</p>
      <div>not applied</div>
      <article>
        <p>not applied><p>
      </article>
      <p>css applied</p>
    </div>

    //here the p nested in the article, it doesnt get the css applied,but the other p's get their css applied
    //css is applied to only the direct p for the div 
    
    *Descendant
    div p{
      color:red
    } 

    <div>
      <div>not applied</div>
      <p>css applied</p>
      <div>not applied</div>
      <article>
        <p>not applied><p>
      </article>
      <p>css applied</p>
    </div>

    here the level doesnt matter, all the p's get the css applied.
    it doesnt have to be the direct child.
