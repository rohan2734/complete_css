* when we select the .parent .child-1,and add the relative property to it,
  but nothing is changed.
* in the case of the position:absolute and fixed, we see that the element is
  taken out of the document flow, and then its position in context depends on its
  ancestors
* but in the case of position:relative, it is not taken out of the document flow
  and if we add top:50px, and left:50px, it is moved from its position to top:50px and left:50px,
  because , the position in context is the element itself.

* with the position property, we cannot cross change the position in context  of other elements,
  so of children of these elements.

* now if we change the top:300px, it is still visible , but it is below its parent div.
  so if we add the overflow:hidden to the parent

* let us now comment the parent child 1 , style and also the parent div changes
* and let us make it relative, and add some top:200px
* now if we add overflow:hidden, to the body, nothing changes.
* because, the bodys overflow:hidden is moved to the html, by the css, by default, and we cant change it,
* but one thing which we can do is, we can add the overflow:hidden to both the html, and the body
* it will also work, if we add overflow:auto;
* we will only have this problem, if our parent is the body, otherwise we wont have this issue.
