* by defualt, every element has a z-index of 0

* and for the elements , whose position is static, 
  there is no impact for the z-index on those elements

* so as we were trying to make the background image appear below the packages,
  as its position is fixed and is not static, we can add z-index:-1 to it

* when two elements position is fixed, and the z-index is 0, 
  then the order for z-index depends on the order of those elements in the html.

* <div class="background"></div>
    <header class="main-header">

* since the header is after the background image, 
  it is displayed after the background image
