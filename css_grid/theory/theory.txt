css grid : 
we could think of this page as rows and columns 
using grid to position the elements 
positioning the elements becomes easier 

positioning elements on the page, in the place where
you want to have, is one of the complex features in css 

css grid helps us witht that
it allows to define the grid of rows and columns, and then specify
which element should be positioned where 

it is also flexible 

default settings for a grid is 
- it will create one column , 
- and as many rows as we have child elements 

1fr - split the reamining space , 100%-20%- 200px -150px 
it will take the reamining space 
and if we had more tha one column with fraction unit, it will split the  
remaining space with  all the columns which have fraction units.
