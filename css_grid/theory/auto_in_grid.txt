if we have auto in grid-template-rows
then it only has the height to fit in the content 


* if we change it for grid-template-column, so it
 takes space just required to just as big it needs to be 

* same would be true for rows  
* if we add a height :600 to the contianer, then auto fills that up

if we remove auto in grid0template -row, container has its width, but the rows dont fill it

sometimes we dont have four columns with equal size
