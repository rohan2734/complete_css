instead of repeating the columns width 

we can use 
grid-template-column : repeat(4,25%)
now we create 4 columns with 25%

grid-template-rows : we have minimum and maximum height 
5rem minmax(10px ,200px)
first value takes min (as hieght)
and second value is maximum 

minmax also ensures that the grid has minimum value,and max value
