we can also add multiple keyframes 
like percentage values 

@keyframes wiggle {
    0%{
        transform: rotateZ(-10deg)

    }
}

it makes the animation way better 
than using the alternate method 

we can also add ease-out to animation 

animation : wiggle 400ms 3s 8 ease-out none;

timing function 

isnt it wierd to mention it? when we have already keyframes 
itmentions ,how the change from keyframes from 0 to 50% will happen
