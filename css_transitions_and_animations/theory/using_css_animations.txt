css transitions 
animate transitino of a css property from 
one property to another 

css animations are css transitions++
if we have  a block ,and may be want to move to a bigger block 
and color, we can ofcourse use transition ,but if we want more 
control ,we can use animations 

in css animations ,
we define keyframes, and we have got full control, what a 
style  of an element is  , at a given point of time 

we are looking to animate, start hosting CTA button 

when the page loads,we can wiggle it, rotate a bit right, and
rotate a bit left 

with transition it is very hard, it should rotate, and stop 
after a certain time 
until this,it should just iterate b/w moving up and moving down 

an animation is what we need

it always starts with defining key frames
@keyframes name {
    from {
        //defines the starting frame
        transform:rotateZ(0) //we want to start with,where it is initially 
    }
    to{
        //defines the ending frame 
    }
}

this property  will be applied to any element 
this is not a selector, 

rotateZ(10deg) moved the element little bit upward

then we can use this animation as 
.class{
    animation: keyframe-name duration delay iterations direction; 
}
.main-nav__item--cta{
    animation: wiggle 200ms 3s 8 alternate;
}
//delay is right from the beginning of loading the page 
//goback to the starting state and start the next iteration or 
//does it alternate and move back to starting state 

//we can also assign reverse instead of alternate 
//but it is rough ,since it reverses back the keyframes

fill state defines, should the properties  set during the animation 
should that be kept when the animation is finished or not 

default is not keeping it

direction can also be forwards also , what it does is,it keeps 
the final position 

remove alternate and use forwards , you will see that it finishes 
in rotated position

if we use backwards,it will keep the starting state
