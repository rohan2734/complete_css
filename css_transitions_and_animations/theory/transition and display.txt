special case 

backdrop is shown by setting display:none 
to dispay:block

this happens because we add open class 
to backdrop too

now the problem is 
in open class 
we changed the opacity ,display:block 

now we can thing that , so instead of 
using display:none ,we can use opacity:0 
and add transition property on backdrop 

and add linear to opacity 
it is a timing function, so 
that we always move at same speed
now if we reload,we see that,we cant click 
the choose plan 

the yes,no button is not displayed,since 
backdrop has z index of 100

so the solution is display:none on backdrop 

but the problem is,animation is not applied 
on the backdrop
