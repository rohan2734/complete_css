special case 

backdrop is shown by setting display:none 
to dispay:block

this happens because we add open class 
to backdrop too

now the problem is 
in open class 
we changed the opacity ,display:block 

now we can thing that , so instead of 
using display:none ,we can use opacity:0 
and add transition property on backdrop 

and add linear to opacity 
it is a timing function, so 
that we always move at same speed
now if we reload,we see that,we cant click 
the choose plan 

the yes,no button is not displayed,since 
backdrop has z index of 100

so the solution is display:none on backdrop 

but the problem is,animation is not applied 
on the backdrop

watching display wont work 
or if you change the display from none to block or the other way around 
then your transition is going to kick off , even if you are changing some 
other property which is animatable 

if we want it to be working still, we need  to use ,some hacky javascript
we first add backrop style to block , and when closing, we need to put
the other way around too , to none 

that is also not enough,we also have to delay the start of the open 
class , we can do by using set time out 

what this does is, we ensure that we first of all set the display to none 
or block ,or whatever we need 
and then second step , we change that ,
this ensures css to not change all the properties at one step 
and therefore omits the transition 

but it actually first of all changes the display=none  , and then 
the other properties , and hence also plays the transition 

alternative solution is to use z-index:100 !important for open
