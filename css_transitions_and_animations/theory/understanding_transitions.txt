transitions are builtinanimations
they are added byby adding one property :transition 
and by specifying which other property like opacity,or 
position should be watched or animated if it changes

ex: 
box tobe moved towareds us . with transform and translateZ 
then we can animate the change 

we say 
1.which properties to change 
2. how long it should take
3.initial delay 
4.timing function : "start fast end slow "


in themodal 

dispay:none can also be achieved by opacity:0 
but the difference is ,it will still be in the 
Document object flow 

and opacity, unlike display, we can watch it with transition 
property

transform:translateY(-3rem) moves it by upward

we can also use top,but we use transform, when we want to 
animate on this ,because it is watchable with transition and it is 
hardware accelerated 

now the idea is to change these two properties of opacity and
transition with javascript 

so go to open in shared.css 
and add opacity and transform property 

transform:translateY(0) brings it to the original 
position

and also make the opacity: 1 !important 
also for transform , add !important 

now we can apply transition too 
so we can add transition and in that we 
can add opacity 0.5s, (we can add time also )
and instead of  0.5s we can also mention 500ms 
now in same way, we can add 0.5s to transform too

if we want to add only one we can, but if you want to add 
more than one, add opacity 

you can also add a timer function that is 
ease-in or ease-out to the transition property 
as
opacity 200ms ease-in 
ease-in means to start slower and ends faster

we can also add a delay, that is 1s 
then nothing hapens for 1s, and then it displays this 
animation 

opacity 200ms ease-in 1s
